    <description>
      A robust .NET library for managing file snapshots across network locations with high reliability and error recovery.

      SnapshotManager provides network-aware file operations with automatic retry mechanisms, delta detection between snapshots for efficient synchronization, parallel processing with configurable concurrency limits, and intelligent handling of incomplete snapshots due to network issues.

      Key features:
      - Create reliable file and directory snapshots even in unstable network environments
      - Compare snapshots to identify added, modified, and deleted files
      - Recover from network issues and timeout conditions automatically
      - Configure network timeout handling for different environments
      - Historical tracking to validate snapshot completeness
      - Optimized for enterprise file synchronization scenarios

      Particularly useful for maintaining synchronized copies of network shares, creating backup systems, or implementing high-availability file replication.

    <releaseNotes>
      Version 2.0.0 - Major architectural simplification and rewrite.

      BREAKING CHANGES:
      - Removed async/await support - all operations now synchronous
      - Simplified data structures for better performance
      - Replaced SyncOperations with SnapshotComparisonResult
      - Removed advanced features: snapshot recovery, history tracking, network timeouts
      - New dual logger support for operations and deletions

      ADDED:
      - Built-in JSON serialization (SimpleJsonSerializer, JsonReader)
      - Enhanced error handling for network operations
      - Improved retry mechanisms for transient failures
      - Better integration with ConfigManager

      REMOVED:
      - SnapshotRecovery system
      - Async cancellation support
      - Snapshot validation and history
      - Network timeout configuration
      - Complex merge operations

      MIGRATION REQUIRED: This is not backward compatible with v1.x.x
      - Replace await SnapshotManager.CreateSnapshotAsync() with SnapshotManager.CreateSnapshot()
      - Update logger setup from SetLogger() to SetLoggers(mainLogger, deletionLogger)
      - Change SyncOperations handling to SnapshotComparisonResult
      - Update data access from snapshot.Files to snapshot.Directories
