    <description>
      A robust .NET library for managing file snapshots across network locations with high reliability and error recovery.

      SnapshotManager provides network-aware file operations with automatic retry mechanisms, delta detection between snapshots for efficient synchronization, parallel processing with configurable concurrency limits, and intelligent handling of incomplete snapshots due to network issues.

      Key features:
      - Create reliable file and directory snapshots even in unstable network environments
      - Compare snapshots to identify added, modified, and deleted files
      - Recover from network issues and timeout conditions automatically
      - Configure network timeout handling for different environments
      - Historical tracking to validate snapshot completeness
      - Optimized for enterprise file synchronization scenarios

      Particularly useful for maintaining synchronized copies of network shares, creating backup systems, or implementing high-availability file replication.
